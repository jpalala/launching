things to think about before you launch your product

### SEO

Make sure people can easily google your website by typing up the name without the ".com" (aka TLD).

### UX

Can they go from start to finish (from browsing to purchase) without any confusion or issues?

Will it be a delight or a pain to go through any part of the process? Anticipate where they might have a problem and need to call you about it.

UX is not about all the fancy graphics. It's more about having a functional and working site that won't fail.

### Customer Management 

How will you handle your customers when they arrive? Do they contact you? Maybe having a all-in-one contact solution is great if you anticipate a ton of customers. 

### Scalability

Can your systems scale to the demand? Have you tested the site/product rigorously? 

### Security
With relation to scalability, are you prepared for cybersecurity attacks, a DDOS or credit card fraud? Have you checked compliance with PCI etc. Usually if you rely on a third-party to handle your payments, they should be able to have security issues with payment in place. 

If you are on shared-hosting, you need to checke with your hosting provider how good their security is. If you are running your own server, double check if your firewalls are up and if you can survive a DDOS attack.

### Sustainability

How long is your runway for this project? You should know when you'll need to decide when to stop or to keep going.

### Contingencies

Do you have a backup plan? What happens if any emergency arises (you're sick, or the servers go down, your internet goes down?) One business I worked with would not have any customers if the emails did not go through. We had a database added in so we could see if there was any email orders that weren't being received that were in the database.
